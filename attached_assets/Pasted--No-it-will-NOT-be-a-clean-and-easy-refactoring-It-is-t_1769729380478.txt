 No, it will NOT be a "clean and easy" refactoring.
It is technically possible, but for your specific use case (Google Sheets + Bookings), moving from a standard Express server to Serverless Functions is often a trap that leads to frustrating bugs.
Here is why this specific refactor is likely to be messy:
1. The "Stateless" Headache
Express (Current): Your server starts once. You can load variables into memory (e.g., let cachedPricing = ...) and keep them there for hours. You can maintain a persistent connection to Google APIs.
Vercel Serverless: The "server" effectively dies after every single request.
The Consequence: You have to re-authenticate with Google, re-open the connection to the spreadsheet, and re-fetch data every time a user clicks a button. This makes your app significantly slower ("Cold Starts").
2. The Timeout Trap (The "Google Sheets" Issue)
This is the biggest risk.
Express: If your app takes 45 seconds to scan the spreadsheet to check availability, the user sees a loading spinner, but it works.
Vercel:
Hobby Plan: Hard limit of 10 seconds.
Pro Plan: Hard limit of 60 seconds.
The Reality: Google Sheets API is notoriously slow. If you have complex logic (e.g., "Check date X, then update cell Y, then send email"), you will likely hit the 10-second limit. Vercel will kill the process mid-save, potentially corrupting your booking data (e.g., the email sends, but the calendar doesn't update).
3. Middleware Hell
In Express, you probably have lines like app.use(cors()) or app.use(authMiddleware).
You cannot just copy-paste this into Vercel.
You have to manually wrap every single API file with helper functions to handle CORS and Authentication, or rewrite your logic to use Vercel's Edge Middleware. It is tedious work.
4. Code Structure Changes
You have to physically break your app apart.
Current: One file (server.js) likely contains all your logic.
Vercel: You need to split that into many files:
api/get-availability.js
api/book-appointment.js
api/sync-pricing.js
Shared logic (like your Google Auth helper) needs to be extracted into a utils/ folder and imported into every single file.
My Honest Verdict
Complexity Factor	Score	Reason
Code structure	Medium	Splitting server.js is annoying but doable.
Authentication	Medium	Moving auth logic to serverless requires care.
Performance	High Risk	Google Sheets API + Serverless is a bad combination. It is too slow and will trigger timeouts.
Reliability	High Risk	If a function times out halfway through a booking, you get "phantom bookings."
Recommendation
Do not refactor this for Vercel.
You are taking a working app and introducing arbitrary constraints (timeouts, statelessness) that fight against what your app is trying to do (long syncs with Google Sheets).
Do this instead:
Keep the Backend as is: Deploy your Express backend to Railway or Render. It will take 5 minutes, cost $5/month (or be free on trial), and requires zero code changes.
Deploy Frontend to Vercel: Deploy only your Vite/React folder to Vercel.
Link them: Just update your frontend URL to point to https://my-backend-on-railway.app/api.
This gives you the best of both worlds: Vercel's fast frontend hosting and a backend that is allowed to take its time talking to Google Sheets.
