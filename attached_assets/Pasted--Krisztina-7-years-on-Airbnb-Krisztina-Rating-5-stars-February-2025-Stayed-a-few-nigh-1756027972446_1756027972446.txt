We loved our time spent there. 
The house was lovely and we had a stunning view from the terrace. 
Valeriano was also kind and super communicative and shared every important information with us.  
Highly recommended. :)

Beautiful panorama, really quiet and close to nature. We saw a couple of roe deer several times at dawn. We really enjoyed our stay. And the host was infinitely helpful and flexible. Thank you for the opportunity!

Beautiful panoramic accommodation, equipped with all the amenities you need. 
The host is helpful in everything. We found everything we were looking for here: birds chirping, tranquility, nearby restaurants and real relaxation!

We had a great time even though the weather wasn't kind to us.
Verőce is a real retreat, for which this accommodation is perfectly suited.

A great cottage in a beautiful location and the amenities were great. You just have to pay attention to how you drive to the cottage. Google Maps led us through the forest to the cottage, but that route is not suitable for regular cars. You have to drive through the town and the church, that route is fine to do.
